webapi-utils
============

Node.js / Express utilities and middlewares for Web APIs 


Requirements
------------
Node.js  **> v6.3.x**

Tested with Express.js **v.4.14.0**

Installation
------------

`npm install webapi-utils`


Available Middlewares
---------------------

**jsonExtension**

This middleware allows to use the dot-notation `.json` in API endpoints URL (Express route paths).
This feature can be used as a shortcut to require JSON representations of resources, instead of using `Accept: application/json`ÃŸ HTTP header only for content-negotiation in an API.


Basic Example
-------------

In your Express `app.js` file, set the path:

```js

app.use('/books(.json)?', books);
```

In your `routes/books.js` Route file:


```js

const middl = require('webapi-utils').middleware;
...

router.use(middl.jsonExtension());
...


/* GET books listing. */
router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.format({
      text: function(){
        res.send(...); //send books as text
      },

      html: function(){
        res.send(...); //send books as html
      },

      json: function(){
        res.send({ books: [...] }); //send books as json
      }
  });
});

```
Using this middleware it will be possible to call your endpoint, also with request like:

`GET /books.json`

or like:

`GET /books`, with `Accept: application/json` HTTP header.
